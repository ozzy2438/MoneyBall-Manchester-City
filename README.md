## Moneyball for Women’s Football

Transfer ROI → League Points (SQL + Power BI)

- **Audience:** Club Owners, Director of Football, Recruitment & Analytics
- **Business Question:** Which players should Manchester City Women buy or sell to maximize league points next season?
- **Deliverable:** A Buy/Sell Decision App that converts player metrics into Predicted Points Uplift.

**Live Report:** [`Power BI (.pbix)`](./powerbi/MoneyBall-Manchester-City.pbix) • **3-min Walkthrough:** ⟮Add Loom/YouTube⟯ • **Slide Deck:** [`docs/deck.pdf`](docs/deck.pdf)

## Executive Summary (30 seconds)

- **Goal:** Turn transfer budget into league points efficiently (Moneyball lens).
- **What I built:** SQL views + a Power BI app with 4 KPIs and 3 visuals tying player quality & role fit to Predicted Points Uplift.
- **Outcome (snapshot):** Projected **+32.9 points** net uplift with **4 sells** freeing **~6K minutes**, while buy targets raise passing accuracy context (comp_pct).
- **Why it matters:** Moves from raw stats to actionable recruitment — each Buy/Sell has a plain-English reason (owner-ready).

---

## Background & Problem

Manchester City Women target the title. The constraint isn’t desire — it’s budget, minutes, and role fit. The question is not “who is good?”, but: **Who adds the most league points given our system and constraints?**

---

## Data & Assumptions

- **Core features:** per-90 performance (xG, xGA, shots), `comp_pct` (passing accuracy proxy), `role_impact_score`, minutes (availability), composite percentile
- **Season context:** trends and budgets via team-season metrics
- **Assumptions:**
  - Predicted Points Uplift learned from historical team performance + player context (feature-engineered in SQL views)
  - Role/fit approximated by `role_impact_score` and position-level `comp_pct`
  - Transfer fees not modeled yet → roadmap to add Pts/£m

---

## How It Works (Architecture)

Pipeline overview

Raw tables → SQL transforms (views) → Power BI model → Decision app (Buy/Sell)

**Key SQL Views (consumed by Power BI):**
- `wsl_v_points_per_goal` — league calibration (goals ↔ points)
- `wsl_v_player_transfer_flags` — rule flags: low_composite, low_role, underfinish, young
- `wsl_v_global_buy_top10` — external targets ranked by `predicted_points_uplift`
- `wsl_v_city_sell_top5` — City players to sell (priority + owner reasons)
- `PlayerDecisionFact` — union of Buy & Sell for a single slicer across visuals
- `DimSeason`, `DimPosition` — report slicers

## Metrics & Visuals

**KPIs (top cards)**
- Buy Avg Comp % — passing quality context of buy pool
- Buy Points Uplift (Sum) — total expected league points from buys
- Sell Players — count of exit candidates
- Sell Minutes — minutes freed (budget & squad slots proxy)

**Visuals**
- Priority Players to Buy (Bar): by Predicted Points Uplift
- Priority Players to Sell (Bar): count/priority + owner reasons
- Transfer Value Map (Scatter):
  - X: `comp_pct` (passing accuracy)
  - Y: `predicted_points_uplift`
  - Legend: position; Size: minutes; Tooltips: scenario, reasons, etc.

**Slicers (apply to everything)**
- `season` (DimSeason) • `position` (DimPosition)

---

## Key Insights

- Buy value exists where `comp_pct` is high and `role_impact_score` is strong, even if raw goals aren’t top.
- Sell candidates cluster with low composite and low role impact, or persistent underfinishing — freeing minutes reduces injury-risk concentration and funds buys.
- Budget has not linearly translated into points — allocation quality > allocation size.

---

## Recommendations (Insight → Action)

| Insight | Action | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| High `comp_pct` + strong role fit correlates with uplift | Buy top-3 targets from `wsl_v_global_buy_top10` | +⟮X.X⟯ pts |
| Low composite + low role impact | Sell `wsl_v_city_sell_top5` candidates | Free ⟮6K⟯ mins; reduce risk |
| Defensive transition leaks (xGA context) | Add DF/MF hybrid (1st priority) | ⟮Y⟯ pts prevention |
| Chance creation plateau | Add FW/MF creator | ⟮Z⟯ pts via chance quality |

Each row is traceable in the app — every buy/sell has plain-English reasons (+ key metrics).

## Design Notes & Accessibility

- Trend-first, minimal color, consistent typography
- No “chart junk” (limited icons; bookmarks only for slicer panel)
- All visuals and KPIs respond to shared slicers (season/position)
- Table includes the same fields used in tooltips/KPIs for coherence

---

## Limitations & Stakeholder Questions

- No transfer fee/wage data yet → next step: Pts/£m by player
- Injury/availability not modeled — scenario page planned
- Questions: Are there tactical role constraints for priority buys? Budget ceiling? Home-grown constraints?
